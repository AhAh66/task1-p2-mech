# 3D Design Project for a Fictional Piece

## Description
This project involves designing a fictional piece using Onshape. The design is inspired by the **Arc Reactor** from Iron Man. The goal of this project is to create a 3D model that reflects creativity in design and engineering using modern tools. The design features symmetry and precision, with several components such as interlocking rings and supporting elements that give it a futuristic and technical appearance.

**"Iron Man's reactor is essentially a fusion reactor that harnesses energy by removing electrons from Hydrogen atoms. This removal of electrons creates an ion plasma, which is the ultimate source of energy. What makes the miniature reactor both so incredible as well as breathtaking is twofold."**
as a beginner i found that it is hard to do it but i did it anyway

### Key Components:
- **Inner Ring**: Represents the reactor's core, providing the foundation for the design.
- **Golden Radial Elements**: Act as supporting structures and energy distributors with an aesthetic touch.
- **Outer Frame**: Enhances the structure and ensures stability.

## Tools Used
The following tools were utilized in creating the design:
1. **Extrude Add & Remove**: To create solid and hollow shapes.
2. **Revolve**: To form circular components like rings.
3. **Sweep**: For drawing curved paths.
4. **Loft**: To connect different shapes and create smooth designs.
5. **Shell**: For hollowing out internal parts and achieving a lightweight design.
6. **Fillet**: To smoothen sharp edges.
7. **Coloring and Materials**: To add colors and simulate metallic materials.
